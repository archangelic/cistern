It will ask you to give it a name, give the url, and it will give the option to supply a custom download directory for this feed.  \r\n\r\nOptionally, you can supply these values with options:\r\n```\r\n$ cistern add-feed --name \"Test RSS\" --url \"http://example.com/feed.rss\" --download-dir /absolute/path/to/directory\r\n```\r\n`--name` and `--url` are required to create the feed entry. If no `--download-dir` is supplied, torrents from that feed will be downloaded to Transmission's default download directory.\r\n \r\n## Running Cistern\r\nAt this point, you are ready to run cistern. Running `cistern` by itself will initiate a refresh of all feeds and add all previously undownloaded torrents to Transmission\r\n \r\n## Listing Feeds and Torrents\r\nCistern's list command can list all the feeds or torrents it has. It takes one argument of either `feeds` or `torrents`.\r\nYou can use this command to get IDs for the `enable-feed` or `disable-feed` commands.\r\n```\r\n$ cistern list feeds\r\n  ID  Name      URL                          Download Directory           Enabled\r\n----  --------  ---------------------------  ---------------------------  ---------\r\n   1  Test RSS  http://example.com/feed.rss  /absolute/path/to/directory  Yes\r\n```\r\n \r\n## Enabling and Disabling Feeds\r\nIf you know the ID to your RSS feed, you can choose to enable it or disable it using the `disable-feed` or `enable-feed` commands.\r\n```\r\n$ cistern disable-feed 1\r\nTest RSS disabled!\r\n\r\n$ cistern enable-feed 1\r\nTest RSS enabled!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Refreshing feeds\r\nIf you want to just read the feeds to refresh the cache of torrents, simply run this command\r\n```\r\n$ cistern refresh\r\n```\r\n",
